Plugin to create a <= 20 character identifier for Organizational Identity
login identifiers. This is because Research Navigator cannot accept login
identifiers of > 20 characters.

Because Organizational Identities created via EnvSource are read only, we
don't attach the abbreviated identifier to the Organizational Identity it
is associated with. Instead, we attach it to the CO Person, and assign it
type "shortorgid".

The actual identifier is of the form <originalidentifier>:EXT<shortkey>.
The portion to be provisioned directly to Research Navigator begins with "EXT".
The full syntax is intended for the SAML proxy to be able to map between the
original identifier and the shortened version.

NOTE: This means the custom Extended Type "shortorgid" must be created
before this plugin is activated.

NOTE: This plugin is hardcoded for CO ID #2.
